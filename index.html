    <p>I’m up to something. Bless up. Wraith talk. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. 
      I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. 
      I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth.
    </p>
      
    <p>Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. 
        In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Hammock talk come soon. Hammock talk come soon. 
        Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, 
        I’m just getting started. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. Surround yourself with angels. 
        The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.
    </p>
    <p>In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Bless up. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. 
      I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. 
      The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.
